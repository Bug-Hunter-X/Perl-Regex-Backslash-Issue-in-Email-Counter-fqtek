This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common error in regular expressions: the misuse of backslashes when matching email addresses. The script `bug.pl` contains the flawed code, which misinterprets the backslashes. The solution, `bugSolution.pl`, demonstrates the correct usage, resolving the issue.  This example highlights the importance of understanding how Perl interprets backslashes within regex patterns.
